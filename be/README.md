## My backend API

# Backend Structure Overview

The backend of our application is designed to be modular and organized. Below you will find an overview of the directory and file structure that encompasses the data migrations, schemas, and server functionalities.

## Directory and File Structure

### `prisma`
This directory manages the database schema and migrations.

- **migrations**
  - Contains all migration files necessary for setting up and updating the database schema.
- **schema.prisma**
  - Defines the data models and types used throughout the application.

### `Useful Scripts`
Scripts that aid in the development and maintenance of the server.

- **scripts/importData.js**
  - A script used to import mocked data into the server. This is particularly useful for initializing the database or resetting it to a default state.

### `Server`
The server logic is divided into specific modules to manage different aspects of the application.

- **games.js**
  - Manages all server-side functionalities related to games.
- **developers.js**
  - Handles functionalities pertaining to the developers' data and interactions.
- **server.js**
  - The main server file that integrates all modules and handles the overall server configuration and middleware.

## Development Notes

- Each server module (`games.js` and `developers.js`) should focus solely on its respective domain to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
- Regularly update the `schema.prisma` file to reflect any changes in the database structure.
- Use `importData.js` script wisely to manage test data during development phases.

This document is intended to assist in the understanding and further development of the backend architecture. Please adhere to the described structure to ensure consistency and efficiency in backend management.
